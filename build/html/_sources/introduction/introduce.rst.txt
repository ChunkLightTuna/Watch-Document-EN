Background
*************

With the development of smart homes and IOTs in the past two years, not only computers, the Internet of Things also involves smart phones and household appliances, as well as smart bracelets, watches and items and equipment that are closely related to our lives. At present, the functions of these smart watches and wristbands are similar. The smart bracelets are mainly used to record sports data, message push, call reminder, and heart rate monitoring. For smart watches, the functions may be more abundant, such as dial change, support call, GPS positioning, photo recording, offline payment and other smart phone functions. And our product is different, T-Watch is a programmable smart watch!

Why should I program?
***********************

Why does the watch support programmable? Why are many of us going to learn programming? Why children from Europe and the United States are more creative and imaginative.


The father of Scratch once commented on modern students: "There are two kinds of students in the world, one is "A-type students", that is, they have been learning very well from elementary school to high school, and although the A-type students have good test scores, they are step by step, not Having the creativity and innovation necessary to succeed in today's society.

The other is "X-type students." “X-type students” are willing to take risks and try to try new things; they are eager to ask their own questions instead of simply solving the problems in the textbooks. ”


With the development of technology, the demand for X-type talents will become larger and larger. So learning programming is a top priority. Interest is the best teacher, we use T-Wathch programmable smart watch as a platform and medium, with Scratch, micropython and other popular programming languages. Greatly reduced the threshold for learning programming.
